# Link-Shortener
A link shortener using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Bitly API converts long URLs into shorter, shareable ones. The user inputs a long URL, and JavaScript sends it to the Bitly API, which returns a shortened version. The result is displayed on the webpage, with Bitly's API handling the actual shortening process.
